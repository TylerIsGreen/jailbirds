                    <p>
                        Jailbirds MC also know as the American Jailbirds Association was founded in 2024 by Colt Steele,
                        Jimmy Carter, Santino “Tino” Hernandez, Rob “Sleepy” Johnson, and James “old timer” Wesley. Colt
                        was originally the president of the Goliaths MC San Diego charter. While serving a short
                        sentence for assault and battery he met the others who decided to join up with Colt when they
                        were released. Things were great for a time but trouble was on the horizon. Conflict started
                        between charters of Goliaths which lead to a bloody war for control. After what is known as the
                        “Berdoo massacre” Colts charter decided enough was enough and determined it was best to split
                        off and form their own club. The name Jailbirds was chosen to honor how all the founding members
                        originally met. Unfortunately that did not sit well with the Goliaths national president who
                        sent a charter to attack the Jailbirds MC. In the conflict James “old timer” Wesley and his son
                        Darko tragically lost their life. Fortunately the conflict did end with Jailbirds on top with no
                        Goliaths left to pose a threat.
